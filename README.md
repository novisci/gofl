Domain specific language for defining subgroups
-----------------------------------------------

A common task in data analysis is to examine statistics within multiple subgroups of the overall population. `gofl` is a simple DSL in `R` for specifying groupings. The compiled result can be applied to a `data.frame` to create a `list` of subgroups.  The syntax is similar to `R`'s model formula syntax and will be familiar to most `R` users. 

See [Get Started](articles/gofl.html) for more details.
